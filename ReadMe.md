# WORDLE GAME CLONE

In this project, I attempted to create a WORDLE game clone since it is a game that I love playing everyday, and I thought how hard could making it be?
SPOILER: very hard..

## 1. Start Page

![adding picture test]()
```javascript
const perfectSandiwch = (GoodIngredients) => {
  // whatever your heart desires
}
```

### quality ingredients includes:
* **good bread**: good bread makes or breaks a sandwich.
* **a fresh protein**: adding protein is important for the gains 
* **good cutting knife**: good kitchen knife can make the process of preparing a sandwich smoother
* **fresh vegetables**: fresh vegetables add great texture


 > Tip: Searing your sandwich in butter and lightly toasting it in a pan would make any sandwich a 10/10. 

## 2. Adding a vegetable

People usually forget that sandwiches can include vegetables which can add a lot of color and texture to a sandich.

***Example:***

1. adding some fresh romaine lettuce
2. adding some pickles
3. adding fresh or roasted tomatoes


## 3. Using Sauces and Spreads

Sauces and spreads can add a lot of flavor with a simple addition. 

***Example:*** 

1.A pesto spread is lovely with mozerella and tomatoes
2.Peanut butter and jam is always a good combo
3.some light honey can add some definition to most sandwiches
