User stories:
  - As a user, I want to be able to see if the word I entered has matching letters or not.
  - As a user, I want to be able to see the word of the day if I failed at guessing it correctly.
  - As a user, I want to be able to see the letters that I have previously chosen.


Pseudocode:

//user enters a five letter word

--------------for each letter------------------------------------------------
//IF the user enters an "acceptable" word
  //THEN the computer checks the "correctnes" of each letter
    //IF the letter is in the right position,
      //THEN the letter's tile will turn green
    //ELSE IF the letter is correct but not in the right position
      //THEN the letter's tile will turn yello
    //ELSE the letter's tile will turn grey


----------for the entire word and no. of guesses-------------------------------

//IF the number of correct tiles = 5
  //THEN display "genius! you guessed the word  " message
//ELSE check the number of guesses left
  //IF the number of guesses is < 6
      //THEN the user will be allowed to enter a new guess
 //ELSE the word of the day will be displayed    

    

  ----------plan for me-------------------------------------------------


  mon 8/7-
1- create accepted words arrray
2- create banned words array
3- make the clicked letter box display the value of the alphabet key that is clicked, in-order
so first key value is displayed in first box, and second key value is displayed in second box, and so on until the fifth box
after all the boxes are filled, AND user clicks enter, check if entered word is part of banned words array or not
if do not display or change anything (neither letter box colors or alphabet keys chosen colors)
else compare each letter with letter of same position in word of the day, if it matches make letter box green AND alphabet key green

else compare the letter with the rest of the letters of the word, if it finds a match make letter box yellow AND alphabet key yellow
else make both letter box and alphabet key grey
