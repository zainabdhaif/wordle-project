User stories:
  - As a user, I want to be able to see if the word I entered has matching letters or not.
  - As a user, I want to be able to see the word of the day if I failed at guessing it correctly.
  - As a user, I want to be able to see the letters that I have previously chosen.


Pseudocode:

//user enters a five letter word

--------------for each letter------------------------------------------------
//IF the user enters an "acceptable" word
  //THEN the computer checks the "correctnes" of each letter
    //IF the letter is in the right position,
      //THEN the letter's tile will turn green
    //ELSE IF the letter is correct but not in the right position
      //THEN the letter's tile will turn yello
    //ELSE the letter's tile will turn grey


----------for the entire word and no. of guesses-------------------------------

//IF the number of correct tiles = 5
  //THEN display "genius! you guessed the word:) " message
//ELSE check the number of guesses left
  //IF the number of guesses is < 6
      //THEN the user will be allowed to enter a new guess
 //ELSE the word of the day will be displayed
